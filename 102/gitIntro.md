# Git and version control

## What is Git?
Git is a Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) Developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, chief architect of Linux.

Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows. In contast to older Centraliized Version Control Systems (CVCS) These multiple mirrored repositories also reduce the risk of catastrophic data loss. 

## GitHub

GitHub is a hub-focused tool which facilitates Integration-Manager Workflow. It is the largest existing host for Git repositories and is used by millions of developers worldwide. A high percentage of Git repositories reside on GitHub, and this resource is used by many open source projects.
