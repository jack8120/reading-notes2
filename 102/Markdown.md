# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 
Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

Unlike a WYSIWYG editor Markdown uses syntax in the text to indicate which words should look different, 
similar to applying CSS to html this applies basic formatting to the document.

the table below shows some common examples
