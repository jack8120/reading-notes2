# Text Editors

## “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

What features should you look for in a text editor? 

I would say some of the most important features are: 

1.) Code completion 
2.) Syntax highlighting
3.) Variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue) 
4.) Selection of extensions 

"basic" editors like notepad were not designed for web development and lack the 
functionality and efficiecies offered by coding-specific text editors.

IDE's are convenient in that they offer a development 'ecosystem' where everything is preconfigured and you can just jump in and get to work. 
This can provide standardisation accross an organisation but may come with an extra learning curve for new users to master.
